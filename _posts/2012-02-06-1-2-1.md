Adauth's development has slowed a lot of late as I've had other priorities (see [Kashflow API Gem](http://www.arcath.net/post/Kashflow_API_Gem)) to the point that 1.2.1 is a collection of bug fixes and community submitted code.

First off Adauth now catches timeouts and reports that the server isn't available, you can of course catch the error and handle it how you like. When the error is raised it means that either your domain controller is off or Adauth is mis-configured.

It was raised in issue [#19](https://github.com/Arcath/Adauth/pull/19) that Adauth was doing some processing on the return data before passing it into the supplied block, which meant that if you wanted to interact with the raw data instead of a to_s'ed version of it you would have to change it back.

Issue [#20](https://github.com/Arcath/Adauth/issues/20) is a Ruby 1.9 compatibility issue where it was adding \[" ... "\] around strings returned from LDAP. It has been fixed for people using the generated code, and 1.3 should contain the fix for all users.
