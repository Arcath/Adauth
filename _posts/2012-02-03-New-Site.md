Adauths Documentation site has been through a few changes and has never really been up to date, even the wiki has lagged behind on occasion.

Arcath.net is perfectly capable of hosting the site but its not editable by anyone which burdens me with documenting every single change. So it its now hosted using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) as the project site for Adauth, which means that anyone can edit the site by forking adauth and modifying the _gh-pages_ branch.

I ask that anyone making changes to Adauth modify this site as appropriate.
